      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol class="directions">
        <li>For the filling… Add the butter and oil into a large saucepan and add the onions, carrot, celery and celery seeds, season well with salt and pepper. Cook over a low heat to sweat down the vegetables. Cook without colour, until completely soft and tender. Don’t rush this step. Add the garlic and sauté for a few minutes.</li>

        <li>Add the curry powder… turn up the heat to a medium flame and add the curry powder to the pan, cook for a minute while stirring.</li>

        <li>Add plain flour… and stir through well to cook out. Then add the white wine and again stir well. Reduce the wine by half and add the stock.</li>

        <li>Add the diced potato… and simmer gently until the potato is completely cooked and soft and the curry flavour has developed. This step takes time, anywhere up to 10 – 15 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add the cream… to the pan and simmer gently until the mixture thickens.</li>

        <li>Lastly add the whole scallops… with the peas and corn, stir and bring back to a simmer. Remove from the heat and squeeze in the lemon juice and stir in the apple cider vinegar. Adjust the seasoning to taste and stir well.</li>

        <li>Leave to cool in the pan… for 15 minutes before transferring the filling into a container. Cover with a lid and refrigerate until cool.</li>

        <li>Make the egg wash… add the yolks to a bowl and add the cream and salt, mix well with a fork and pass the egg wash through a sieve into a fresh bowl. Take a pastry brush and brush the strip of puff pastry with the egg wash. Place the strip of pastry into the fridge to chill.</li>

        <li>Line the tins… Use canola spray to grease the tins and take a 16 cm disc of puff pastry, push the pastry gently into the tin ensuring the pastry is pushed against the inside and in the edges. Leave some pastry to overlap and repeat with the remaining two tins and pastry.</li>

        <li>Fill the pies… use a spoon to add the filling into the lined pies, ensure 8 scallops go into each pie along with all the mix evenly distributed.</li>

        <li>Egg wash the overhang… take the pastry brush and lightly brush some egg wash on the rim of the pastry at the top of each pie, this will help stick the lid in place. At this point remove the strip of puff pastry from the fridge and coat it with a second layer of egg wash. Take a fork and score straight lines along the length of the strip of pasty, you will need to use the fork a couple of times to achieve a series of straight lines along the entire surface of the pastry. This part is for the fancy scallop topping part of the pie. Put the strip back into the fridge.</li>

        <li>Lid the pies… take the 12 cm diameter discs of puff pastry and start to lid the pies. Place a lid onto each pie and use your fingers to pinch the lid to the lined pastry rim. Make sure the lid is attached firmly to each pie. Take the egg wash and brush the surface of each pie nice and evenly. Pop the pies into the fridge to chill for 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Remove the strip of egg washed pastry… from the fridge and cut out scallop shapes as shown. I used a 5 cm diameter round cutter (plain or fluted is fine) and then timed the scallop shape using a knife. Ensure the scored lines go from the top of the shell to the bottom as shown.</li>

        <li>Remove the pies from the fridge… and egg wash the surface a second time. Take a small knife or palette knife and lift a scallop shaped pastry piece and put it into the centre of each pie. The pies are now ready to bake but I like to chill them in the fridge first for an hour to rest the pastry and set the glaze on top.</li>

        <li>To bake… preheat your oven to 200C and remove the pies from the fridge. Place them onto a baking tray and put them into the oven. Bake for 20 minutes and reduce the heat on the oven 180C, open the oven door and turn your tray around to ensure even cooking. Cook for a further 15 – 20 minutes to ensure the pastry is cooked inside the tin. Turn the oven off and leave the pies inside the oven for a further 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for a further 20 minutes. Demould carefully from the tin and reheat to serve immediately or refrigerate and reheat later. These pies can be frozen cooked or uncooked and can be baked from frozen as well, you will need to adjust the cooking time if baking from frozen.</li>

        <li>Serve with a side salad</li>
